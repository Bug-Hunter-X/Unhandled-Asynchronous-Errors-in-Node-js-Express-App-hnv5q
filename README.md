# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Node.js Express App

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js applications: unhandled errors within asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js server that might throw an error during request handling.  The `bugSolution.js` file showcases how to correctly handle this with proper error handling techniques. 

## Problem
Asynchronous operations, such as those commonly used with databases or external APIs, might throw errors. If these errors are not properly handled, the application could crash without a clear indication of what went wrong.

## Solution
Use `try...catch` blocks within asynchronous callbacks, or promise `.catch()` to handle potential errors and prevent crashes. Implement robust logging to monitor errors and facilitate debugging.  In larger applications, consider using a centralized error-handling mechanism for cleaner and more manageable error tracking.
